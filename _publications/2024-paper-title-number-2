excerpt: 'Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable and functionally impairing disease. The recognition and intervention of BD especially that characterized by early onset remains challenging. Risk biomarkers for predicting BD transition among at-risk youth may improve disease prognosis. We reviewed the more recent clinical studies to find possible pre-diagnostic biomarkers in youth at familial or (and) clinical risk of BD.'
